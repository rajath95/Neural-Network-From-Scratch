# A Neural Network from Scratch


Try and simulate an OR Gate in an neural network

## Details
  Layers: 1
  
  Iterations: 1000
  
  Input Size: (1,3)
  
  Output Size: (1,)
  
  Activation: Sigmoid
  
  
 We try and build an neural network to mimic an OR gate. This network is built solely using numpy library. 
It is a single layer neural network. We train using 1000 epochs and  sigmoid function is used for activation. 
The network takes 3 input signals of either 0 or 1. Weights are randomly initialized.
